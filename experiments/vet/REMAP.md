# Remap Manifest — mycelium-std-sys → std.sys

_DN-109 §5.2 provenance ledger. Guarantee: **Declared** — this records proposed/performed structural and idiom choices; it does not certify them (no guarantee-tag upgrade from the manifest's existence alone, VR-5). Rendered from `remap` in `summary.json` — this file is a pure projection, never a second source of truth._
